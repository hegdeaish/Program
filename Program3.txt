You are given an array of unique integers salary where salary[i] is the salary of the ith employee.

Return the average salary of employees excluding the minimum and maximum salary. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.

 

Example 1:

Input: salary = [4000,3000,1000,2000]
Output: 2500.00000
Explanation: Minimum salary and maximum salary are 1000 and 4000 respectively.
Average salary excluding minimum and maximum salary is (2000+3000) / 2 = 2500



class Solution {
    public double average(int[] salary) {
        int min = salary[0];
        int max = salary[0];

        int n = salary.length;
        int count = 0;
        int sum = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (max < salary[i]) {
                max = salary[i];
            }
            if (min > salary[i]) {
                min = salary[i];
            }
        }

        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (salary[j] != min && salary[j] != max) {
                sum += salary[j];
                count++;
            }
        }

        return (double) sum / count;
    }
}
